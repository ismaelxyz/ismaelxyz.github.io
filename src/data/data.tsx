        Greetings! My name is Ismael Belisario. I am a{" "}
        <strong className="text-stone-100">Software Developer</strong> from the
        Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a country rich in culture and
        diversity. Since my childhood, I have been surrounded by inspiration and
        motivation, thanks to my parents, both education professionals, who have
        instilled in me the importance of perseverance and personal growth.
      </p>
      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        My journey into the world of programming began when I was 14 years old,
        in 2010. Back then, my learning was based on reading technical books, as
        I didn&apos;t have access to the internet very often. Those days of
        self-taught study taught me not only about algorithms and programming
        languages, but also about resilience and determination.
      </p>
      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        Over time, my arsenal of skills has grown exponentially. I have embraced
        technological evolution, adapting and expanding my knowledge in areas
        such as{" "}
        <strong className="text-stone-100">
          test-driven development (TDD), data structures, frameworks, the
          intricate worlds of interpreters and compilers
        </strong>
        , among other topics.
      </p>

      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        Today, I pride myself on having a solid technical background and a
        burning passion for my profession. I have had the privilege of
        developing <strong className="text-stone-100">websites</strong> and{" "}
        <strong className="text-stone-100">mobile applications</strong>, as well
        as implementing process automation (
        <strong className="text-stone-100">RPA</strong>), with a particular
        focus on optimising administrative tasks.
      </p>

      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        My commitment to best practices and design patterns is unwavering, and
        my thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. I am convinced that learning is
        a never-ending journey, and each new project is an opportunity to
        explore unknown horizons.
      </p>
      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">

          I worked as a backend developer, participating in the design,
          construction, and maintenance of robust and scalable services. In
          particular, I integrated AI solutions via OpenAI APIs and platforms
          like OpenRouter, building conversational flows, natural language
          processing pipelines, and recommendation systems that responded
          dynamically to user needs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Throughout these projects, I implemented service-oriented
          architectures and handled authentication, authorization, error
          handling, and data persistence securely and efficiently. I also
          designed highâ€‘performance, lowâ€‘latency endpoints to ensure smooth
          communication between system components.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To guarantee code quality, I incorporated automated tests at multiple
          levels (unit, integration, and functional), along with static analysis
          to detect errors, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities
          before deployment. These practices helped maintain clean and
          maintainable code aligned with professional standards.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In addition, I participated in CI/CD workflows to ensure every change
          passed automated validations before reaching production. Combined with
          code reviews and clear technical documentation, this contributed to
          the stability and continuous evolution of the backend systems I
          developed.

          architecture design to implementation, testing, deployment, and
          maintenance. I contributed to both the frontend and backend, ensuring
          the solutions were functional, scalable, and aligned with project
          goals.

        <p>
          I collaborated on building dynamic, accessible user interfaces and
          robust server-side systems. I worked in agile environments where clear
          communication across multidisciplinary teams, code reviews, and solid
          documentation were key to delivering quality products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I integrated quality assurance practices such as automated testing
          (unit, integration, and end-to-end), static code analysis to detect
          issues early and maintain style standards, and CI/CD pipelines that
          enabled safe and efficient validation and deployment of changes. I
          also participated in deployments using containers and Kubernetes
          orchestration, improving scalability, resilience, and production
          monitoring.

          My focus was always on building maintainable, reliable, and

          Outlook, SharePoint, and Teams. I implemented automated workflows that
          extracted, transformed, and synchronized data across platforms, often

          reliability.

        <p>
          On the backend, I contributed using Django and FastAPI, building APIs that

          these solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging services like
          Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Connectivity Tests to enable scalable,
          event-driven automation. I also configured environments in Microsoft Azure to
