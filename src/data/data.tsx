      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        Greetings! My name is Ismael Belisario. I am a{" "}
        <strong className="text-stone-100">Software Developer</strong> from the
        Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a country rich in culture and
        diversity. Since my childhood, I have been surrounded by inspiration and
        motivation, thanks to my parents, both education professionals, who have
        instilled in me the importance of perseverance and personal growth.
      </p>
      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        My journey into the world of programming began when I was 14 years old,
        in 2010. Back then, my learning was based on reading technical books, as
        I didn&apos;t have access to the internet very often. Those days of
        self-taught study taught me not only about algorithms and programming
        languages, but also about resilience and determination.
      </p>
      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        Over time, my arsenal of skills has grown exponentially. I have embraced
        technological evolution, adapting and expanding my knowledge in areas
        such as{" "}
        <strong className="text-stone-100">
          test-driven development (TDD), data structures, frameworks, the
          intricate worlds of interpreters and compilers
        </strong>
        , among other topics.
      </p>

      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        Today, I pride myself on having a solid technical background and a
        burning passion for my profession. I have had the privilege of
        developing <strong className="text-stone-100">websites</strong> and{" "}
        <strong className="text-stone-100">mobile applications</strong>, as well
        as implementing process automation (
        <strong className="text-stone-100">RPA</strong>), with a particular
        focus on optimising administrative tasks.
      </p>

      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        My commitment to best practices and design patterns is unwavering, and
        my thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. I am convinced that learning is
        a never-ending journey, and each new project is an opportunity to
        explore unknown horizons.
      </p>
      <p className="prose-sm text-stone-200 sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg">
        I look forward to the possibility of collaborating on your project.
        Together, we can take your ideas to new heights and achieve success -
