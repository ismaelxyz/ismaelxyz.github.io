    "name": "I'm Ismael Belisario",
    "p1": "I'm a Software Developer, born in Venezuela, and I specialize in understanding and building every layer of an application as if it were a living architecture. From the user experience to the deep logic that sustains the system, I get involved in every stage of development with precision and sensitivity. I don't just write functional code: I design solutions that solve real problems, adapt to their environment, and communicate intent. I move fluently across interfaces, internal structures, and automated processes, always seeking for technology to feel natural, useful, and aesthetically coherent.",
    "p2": "Outside of work, I find inspiration at the beach, in books, video games, and classical music. These are spaces where the mind quiets and new ways of thinking emerge.",

  "about": {
    "p1": "Greetings! My name is Ismael Belisario. I am a <1>Software Developer</1> from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a country rich in culture and diversity. Since my childhood, I have been surrounded by inspiration and motivation, thanks to my parents, both education professionals, who have instilled in me the importance of perseverance and personal growth.",
    "p2": "My journey into the world of programming began when I was 14 years old, in 2010. Back then, my learning was based on reading technical books, as I didn't have access to the internet very often. Those days of self-taught study taught me not only about algorithms and programming languages, but also about resilience and determination.",
    "p3": "Over time, my arsenal of skills has grown exponentially. I have embraced technological evolution, adapting and expanding my knowledge in areas such as <1>test-driven development (TDD), data structures, frameworks, the intricate worlds of interpreters and compilers</1>, among other topics.",
    "p4": "Today, I pride myself on having a solid technical background and a burning passion for my profession. I have had the privilege of developing <1>websites</1> and <3>mobile applications</3>, as well as implementing process automation (<5>RPA</5>), with a particular focus on optimising administrative tasks.",
    "p5": "My commitment to best practices and design patterns is unwavering, and my thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. I am convinced that learning is a never-ending journey, and each new project is an opportunity to explore unknown horizons.",
    "p6": "I look forward to the possibility of collaborating on your project. Together, we can take your ideas to new heights and achieve success - let's make your vision a reality😊!",

        "content": "I worked as a backend developer, participating in the design, construction, and maintenance of robust and scalable services. In particular, I integrated AI solutions via OpenAI APIs and platforms like OpenRouter, building conversational flows, natural language processing pipelines, and recommendation systems that responded dynamically to user needs.\n\nThroughout these projects, I implemented service-oriented architectures and handled authentication, authorization, error handling, and data persistence securely and efficiently. I also designed high-performance, low-latency endpoints to ensure smooth communication between system components.\n\nTo guarantee code quality, I incorporated automated tests at multiple levels (unit, integration, and functional), along with static analysis to detect errors, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities before deployment. These practices helped maintain clean and maintainable code aligned with professional standards.\n\nIn addition, I participated in CI/CD workflows to ensure every change passed automated validations before reaching production. Combined with code reviews and clear technical documentation, this contributed to the stability and continuous evolution of the backend systems I developed."

I contributed to both the frontend and backend, ensuring the solutions were functional, scalable, and aligned with project goals.\n\nI collaborated on building dynamic, accessible user interfaces and robust server-side systems. I worked in agile environments where clear communication across multidisciplinary teams, code reviews, and solid documentation were key to delivering quality products.\n\nI integrated quality assurance practices such as automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), static code analysis to detect issues early and maintain style standards, and CI/CD pipelines that enabled safe and efficient validation and deployment of changes. I also participated in deployments using containers and Kubernetes orchestration, improving scalability, resilience, and production monitoring.\n\nMy focus was always on building maintainable, reliable, and user-centered software, with a technical mindset that balances performance, security, and continuous evolution."

        "content": "I primarily worked on RPA development, using tools such as Playwright for browser automation and Python-o365 to interact with Microsoft services like Outlook, SharePoint, and Teams. I implemented automated workflows that extracted, transformed, and synchronized data across platforms, often incorporating testing routines to validate functionality and ensure reliability.\n\nOn the backend, I contributed using Django and FastAPI, building APIs that supported bot orchestration and secure data exchange. I deployed several of these solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging services like Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Connectivity Tests to enable scalable, event-driven automation. I also configured environments in Microsoft Azure to support unattended RPA execution and integrated SharePoint for document management, metadata tagging, and workflow triggers.\n\nThroughout these projects, I focused on automating repetitive tasks, improving operational efficiency, and ensuring seamless integration between cloud services and enterprise tools."

I designed and implemented custom solutions tailored to each client's needs, ensuring that both the user experience and the underlying architecture were robust, scalable, and maintainable.\n\nIn addition to web development, I gained experience in Android app development using Flutter, where I created intuitive mobile interfaces and integrated backend services to deliver seamless cross-platform experiences. I was responsible for gathering requirements, translating them into technical specifications, and executing full-cycle development—from prototyping and UI/UX design to deployment and post-launch support.\n\nThroughout my freelance work, I remained committed to technical excellence, incorporating automated testing (unit and integration) to ensure code reliability and reduce regressions. I also worked with cloud platforms like Google Cloud (GCP) and Microsoft Azure.\n\nMy approach emphasized clear communication, agile iteration, and a deep focus on customer satisfaction, ensuring that each project not only met functional requirements but also reflected a thoughtful and elegant technical execution."
