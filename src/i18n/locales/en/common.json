    "p1": "Greetings! My name is Ismael Belisario. I am a <1>Software Developer</1> from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a country rich in culture and diversity. Since my childhood, I have been surrounded by inspiration and motivation, thanks to my parents, both education professionals, who have instilled in me the importance of perseverance and personal growth.",
    "p2": "My journey into the world of programming began when I was 14 years old, in 2010. Back then, my learning was based on reading technical books, as I didn't have access to the internet very often. Those days of self-taught study taught me not only about algorithms and programming languages, but also about resilience and determination.",
    "p3": "Over time, my arsenal of skills has grown exponentially. I have embraced technological evolution, adapting and expanding my knowledge in areas such as <1>test-driven development (TDD), data structures, frameworks, the intricate worlds of interpreters and compilers</1>, among other topics.",
    "p4": "Today, I pride myself on having a solid technical background and a burning passion for my profession. I have had the privilege of developing <1>websites</1> and <3>mobile applications</3>, as well as implementing process automation (<5>RPA</5>), with a particular focus on optimising administrative tasks.",
    "p5": "My commitment to best practices and design patterns is unwavering, and my thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. I am convinced that learning is a never-ending journey, and each new project is an opportunity to explore unknown horizons.",
    "p6": "I look forward to the possibility of collaborating on your project. Together, we can take your ideas to new heights and achieve success - let's make your vision a realityðŸ˜Š!",
